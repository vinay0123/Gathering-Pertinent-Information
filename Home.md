# Need Statement 
  _For an upcoming event in KLETECH there is a need for the robot which can play musical instruments to entertain audience_
## Introduction:-
   A robotical music instrument is a sound-making device that automatically creates music with the use of mechanical parts such as motors,solenoids and gears.Innovators in academic,entertainment and art circles have been designing musical robots for decades using algorithms and design schemes that are useful to the computer music society. 
   Why build a robot that can play music? Each artist/engineer had their own reasons. All were musicians who had a background in electrical engineering and computer science who wanted to make new vehicles for interesting performance. Some had experience in building interfaces for musical expression using sensors and microcontrollers for MIDI in devices and wanted to see what would happen if they “reversed the equation to create MIDI output devices,” says Eric Singer. JBot from Captured by Robots explains his motivations, “I couldn’t play with humans anymore, humans have too many problems, like drugs, egos,girlfriends, jobs....I figured I could make a band that I could play with until I die, and not worry about if anyone in the band was going to quit, and kill the band. 
In order to design and build a musical robot, one must obtain a myriad of crucial skills for the interdisciplinary artform, including knowledge of acoustics, electrical engineering, computer science,mechanical engineering, and machining (how to use a mill, lathe and welding equipment). Miles Van Dorssen comments, “I had to learn the mathematics of musical
ratios relating to various scales and how waveforms propagate and behave in different shaped media.” Eric Singer adds one of the most daunting skills is “learning how to parse a 5000 page industrial supply catalogue.”
From programming microcontrollers, to programming real-time system code, to using motors, gears and solenoids in conjunction with sensor technology while still having an artistic mind about the look, feel, transportability of the devices being designed, and most importantly, the acoustics and agility for sound making
in order to create expressive music.

   1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwh_acqT6J0 ( Robots Playing Instruments Videos)  
 Using the vs1053 codec chip it has a MIDI player built into it (and can play most any audio file- MP3, AAC, Ogg Vorbis, WMA, MIDI, FLAC, WAV. it can also record). Just send serial data to it, and it outputs stereo audio. 

   2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5ofDFLyTWQ (M2M Challenge: Arduino Musical Robots)  
    Georgia Tech’s Robotic Musicians and Musical Cyborgs features Shimon, the robotic marimba player, alongside other robotic musicians and a drummer who wears an assistive robotic drumming prosthesis. Shimon utilizes artificial intelligence and creativity algorithms that push musical experiences and outcomes to uncharted domains.
  
  3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBqdnujBSpI (Robot Guitar - Arduino )  
     The device is a robot that can play a fully automated acustic guitar. 
The commands are transmitted by an android smartphone,that by the means of a terminal Bluetooth send the code to Arduino, this code corresponds to the song to perform. Arduino decodes the received code and processes the program corresponding to one of the tasks stored in memory, providing the actuators (motor steppers and servomotors) the necessary instructions for the correct function of the robot. The guitar is placed horizontally on a smooth and regular surface where all the handcrafted supports are to support the various actuators.

      This is a robot which plays drum according to the command given by arduino mega.It uses mechanical components such as stepper motors, gears, arm.

  5. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttm62RBdOuo (Coke piano launchpad)
     This is coke piano/launchpad. Built using an arduino mega and a python script, with the PyAudio library. Basically, the launchpad can play any sound loop in .wav, so I added some samples and some piano sounds.
The hardware (the protoboard with the arduino and components) is made of lots of transistors for 'body signal' amplification, so the coke I touched activates the transistor (BC548B NPN). The cokes are plugged in directly to the transistor's base with an wire. Then the arduino reads the data and sends it via serial to the python script.

 A partnership between the Orchestra and The University of Manchester’s School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, where Green is a Senior Lecturer, was formed. The aim was to develop a completely new, electronically controlled, acoustic instrument for use with schoolchildren and people with dementia. The instrument would enable children and dementia patients to participate in creating music, allowing them to get involved with writing and devising, alongside the Halle orchestra.Designed and built by the University’s technical apprentices, the **Halléoojamaflipaphone** was the first new musical instrument to be completed. A combination of tubular bells, zither, shakers, drums, cymbals and woodblocks, all controlled from a laptop, the _Haleoojamaflipaphone_ can play anything from Beethoven to hip hop.

 Integrating hyperinstruments, musical robots & machine musicianship for North Indian classical music.This describes a system enabling a human to perform music with a robot in real-time, in the context of North Indian classical music. Modify a traditional acoustic sitar into a hyperinstrument in order to capture performance gestures for musical analysis. A custom built four-armed robotic Indian drummer was built using a microchip, solenoids, aluminum and
folk frame drums. Algorithms written towards “intelligent” machine musicianship are described. The final goal of this
research is to have a robotic drummer accompany a professional human sitar player live in performance.
